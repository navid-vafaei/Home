Hello and welcome to Navid Vafaei's website!

This is the website to represent my projects that I have already done along with all relative and necessary information.

These projects are only for presenting and not for using as they are not open sourse projects for public and therefore I can not pulish whole source codes. Nevetheless, I try to publish some sections with their instructions as far as I can, based on permissions that I receive from employers.
Meanwhile, you can use souce codes that I put here in your projects freely.

This system is responsible for storing, organizing and reporting from this huge data. For example, how namy counters could send their data, how many did not, how much energy has been transfers in one special point - like transformer, lines, sub station, consumer - in a desired duration, with regard to this point that network is not static, it is dynamic. Reports of this data was also used for making decesions in other departments like dispatching affairs or statistc panning offices for forecasting energy. This system also is responsible for calculating and producing customer's bills. Customers are big industries like steel companies such as Mobarakeh Steel Engineering (MSE) Company (https://www.mse.ir/en/) and Esfahan Steel Company (https://www.esfahansteel.ir/en) and many other big companies.
