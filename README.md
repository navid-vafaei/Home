Hello and welcome to my website!

This is the website to represent my projects with any necessary information that I have already done.

These projects are only for presenting and unfortunately, these projects are not open sourse projects and therefore I can not pulish source codes. Nevetheless, I try to publish the sections with some explanations as far as I can, based on permissions that I receive from employers.
Meanwhile, you can use souce codes that I put here in your projects freely.
